# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction

This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and others. The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

age: age of the primary beneficiary
sex: gender of the primary beneficiary
bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the primary beneficiary
children: number of children covered by health insurance / number of dependents
smoker: smoking status of the primary beneficiary (yes/no)
region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
charges: medical insurance cost billed by the insurance company

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

# Usage
Download or clone the repository.
Install the required packages listed above.
Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook Medical Insurance Cost Prediction.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the linear regression model.

# Results
The trained model can predict the cost of medical insurance for new beneficiaries with an accuracy of around 70-80% based on the input features. The model can be further optimized by adding more features or using other regression algorithms.
